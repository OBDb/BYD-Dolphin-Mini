    description: "The BYD Dolphin Mini (known as the Seagull in China) is an ultra-compact, affordable electric hatchback positioned as BYD's entry-level EV offering. Built on a shortened version of BYD's e-platform 3.0, it measures just 3.78 meters in length while offering a relatively spacious four-seat interior. The exterior design follows BYD's 'Ocean Aesthetics' design language with flowing lines, a smooth front fascia, and distinctive LED lighting signatures. Powered by BYD's proprietary Blade Battery technology with LFP (lithium iron phosphate) chemistry, it's equipped with a 38 kWh battery pack providing a CLTC range of approximately  305 km (189 miles). A single front-mounted electric motor produces 75 HP (55 kW) and 135 Nm of torque, sufficient for city driving with a top speed of about 130 km/h (81 mph). Inside, it features a minimalist but modern interior with a rotating 10.1-inch central touchscreen, digital instrument display, and basic comfort features. Despite its budget positioning, it offers smartphone integration, voice control, and essential safety systems. The Dolphin Mini/Seagull has gained significant attention for its extremely competitive pricing—starting under $10,000 in China—making it one of the most affordable purpose-built EVs on the market. This model represents BYD's strategy to democratize electric mobility and expand into price-sensitive markets globally."
